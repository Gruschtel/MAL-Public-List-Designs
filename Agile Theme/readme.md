Made for the 2021 list design competition in Shishio's Club.

Primary goals:

- Simple to use, information is arranged with as much logic as possible.
- Adaptable & usable on many different monitor sizes.
- Lightweight. Does not load an excessive amount of external resources and image assets are only enough to add interest.
